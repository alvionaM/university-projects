# university-projects
This repository includes assignments and projects completed as part of my university courses at AUEB (2020-2024) <br><br>

üí°The most remarkable projects have been selected and are hosted in their respective repositories, which are not included here <br>
‚úîÔ∏èAssignments and projects are categorized based on their related courses and organized into folders by semester <br>
‚ùóÔ∏è Project descriptions, solutions, and code comments are in Greek since the courses were conducted in **Greek**. However, for programming projects, any interaction through the User Interface (i.e., prompts, messages, etc.) requires basic knowledge of the **English** language
