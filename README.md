# university-projects
All of the (other) assignments and projects completed as part of the university courses during my studies in AUEB (2020-2024) <br><br>

üí°The most remarkable projects were selected to be hosted on their own repository and are not included here <br>
‚úîÔ∏èAssignments and projects are grouped according to their related course and organized in folders per Semester <br>
‚ùóÔ∏èProject descriptions, solutions and some code comments are in **Greek** as the university courses were offered in Greek.<br>
  However when it comes to programming projects, any interaction through the User Interface (i.e. prompts, messages etc.) demands **English** solely
